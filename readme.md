## Overview

This project transforms a traditional developer portfolio into an explorable 2D game world. Users navigate a pixel-art environment to discover sections like Projects, About, and Certifications. The interface is built using the KaboomJS game engine and bundled with Vite.

Inspired by [JSLegendDev's 2D Portfolio](https://jslegenddev.github.io/portfolio/), this implementation adapts the concept with custom content and structure.
